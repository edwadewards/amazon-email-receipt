# Amazon Email Transactional Receipt

## About

This project is an HTML Email Template I created based off a design from Dribble for an Amazon Email Receipt.


## What I Learned From This Job

- HTML Table layouts.
- Inline CSS.
- Image hosting & testing across various email providers. 
- Multi Column Layouts  


## What I Enjoyed About Creating This

This one was a little different from my previous email templates that were newsletters and promotional emails. I enjoyed creating something that is useful for both buyers and sellers. I really enjoyed getting to recreate such a sleek, modern design.
